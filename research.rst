Linguistics
===========

.. Note::

   It is **never correct** to call me *he* or *him*, even if you
   are talking about things I wrote before I transitioned. My very favorite
   pronouns are *zie* and *hir*, but *she* and *her* aren't
   wrong.

   It is **never correct** to call me by any given name other
   than Leah outside a bibliography.

   Even in a bibliography, if your editor permits it, my **very strong
   preference** is to be called Leah regardless of what name I was using at the
   time of publication.
