<p>Elder John R. Daily&#8217;s <em>Primitive Baptist Hymn and Tune Book</em> is a seven-shape
Primitive Baptist hymnal with a strikingly distinctive harmonic style. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>
It turns out that many of Daily&#8217;s arrangements come from a few Primitive
Baptist hymnals of the 1880s. One source is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2013/200-years-of-bourbon/">Durant &amp; Lester&#8217;s 1886 &#8220;Hymn and
Tune Book.&#8221;</a>
Another source is Sears &amp; Ausmus&#8217;s 1881 <em>Primitive Baptist Hymnal,</em> which I
haven&#8217;t seen discussed elsewhere. These sources include a number of
arrangements that were later printed in Daily.  They also include some
arrangements that didn&#8217;t make it into Daily, but that are written in a similar
style.</p>
<p>Still, Daily was not just an imitator of these earlier arrangers. The Daily
book includes some arrangements that are originals as far as I can tell, and
others that are improvements or refiniments of works from D&amp;L or S&amp;A.</p>
<p>In other words, what I&#8217;ve come to think of as the &#8220;Daily book style&#8221; wasn&#8217;t
just the work of one eccentric arranger. It was part of an ongoing tendency in
Primitive Baptist harmony. S&amp;A is the earliest source I&#8217;ve found for this
style, but Daily and D&amp;L were active contributors, and it is possible that
there were other authors involved too.</p>

<h2>Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#conflict" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The song CONFLICT, which was recently repopularized in the <em>Shenandoah
Harmony,</em> illustrates several of the Daily book&#8217;s distinctive features.
Daily&#8217;s harmonies lean heavily towards major keys, and he reharmonizes many
old minor-key folk hymns with borrowings from the relative major. His
arrangements often uses <cite>IV</cite> chords where earlier books like the Sacred Harp
would use <cite>ii</cite> or <cite>vi</cite> — and in minor-key songs, he makes heavy use of the
<cite>IV</cite> chord of the relative major <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f3" id="id2">[2]</a>. His arrangement for CONFLICT ends its
first and last
phrases in
minor, but spends most of the rest of the song in the relative major, with
heavy use of the relative major <cite>IV</cite> chord.</p>
<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/95636767&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto*play=false&amp;hide*related=false&amp;show*comments=true&amp;show*user=true&amp;show*reposts=false"></iframe><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2013/200-years-of-bourbon/"><img alt="../../_images/daily119conflict.png" src="../../_images/daily119conflict.png" /></a>
<p>The Better Music movement, spearheaded by Lowell Mason, also favored major keys
and traditional <cite>I-IV-V</cite> harmonies. But Daily&#8217;s harmonies are not just a copy of
the ones favored by Mason and friends. For instance, a number of songs in the
Daily book also have what Rachel Wells Hall has called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2014/questioning-the-unanswered-cadence/">unanswered cadences</a>
forbidden in Mason&#8217;s &#8220;scientific&#8221; harmony — in which a major-key piece ends
unexpectedly on <cite>IV</cite>, <cite>V</cite> or <cite>vi</cite>, rather than <cite>I</cite>.</p>
<p>Daily&#8217;s own version of CONFLICT does not have an unanswered cadence. But as
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2013/200-years-of-bourbon/">Rachel points out</a> an earlier
version in D&amp;L did have one.  In that book it was completely recast in major,
with no trace of its minor-key origins, and in order to accommodate the last
note of the tune it ended on <cite>IV</cite> rather than <cite>I</cite>.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/HTBU1886/425)"><img alt="../../_images/lester171conflict.png" src="../../_images/lester171conflict.png" /></a>
<p>As it turns out, this earlier version of CONFLICT did not originate with
D&amp;L. It appeared several years earlier in S&amp;A:</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="other-songs">
<h2>Other songs<a class="headerlink" href="#other-songs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In fact, many of the harmonically adventurous arrangements from the Daily book
and D&amp;L appeared in S&amp;A first.</p>
<p>Conquering soldier <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/280">S&amp;A 93</a>,
Daily 211) is a lovely example. This arrangement, which first appeared in
S&amp;A, takes the minor-key tune which appears in the Sacred Harp as 201 PILGRIM
and reharmonizes it entirely in major, resorting to an unanswered cadence on
<cite>IV</cite> to accommodate the last note.  For this song, Daily does not make any
significant changes to S&amp;A&#8217;s arrangement. In particular, unlike in
CONFLICT, he keeps the unanswered cadence, which in my opinion is one of the
song&#8217;s finest features. Here&#8217;s the Sacred Harp version of the tune, harmonized
in minor:</p>
<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/75262983&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto*play=false&amp;hide*related=false&amp;show*comments=true&amp;show*user=true&amp;show*reposts=false"></iframe><p>And here&#8217;s the arrangement found in S&amp;A and Daily, reharmonized in major:</p>
<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/209363941&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto*play=false&amp;hide*related=false&amp;show*comments=true&amp;show*user=true&amp;show*reposts=false"></iframe><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/280"><img alt="../../_images/ausmus93soldier.png" src="../../_images/ausmus93soldier.png" /></a>
<p>Another example of these books&#8217; style is SALVATION (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/190">S&amp;A 62</a>, D&amp;L 189, Daily 158). It is
another minor key tune, and begins and ends on the tonic in minor, but the
second half of the tune strays into the relative major. (The high point for me
is at the end of the third line, where the 1-La is harmonized not with a <cite>i</cite>
or <cite>iv</cite> as it usually would be in the Sacred Harp, but with <cite>IV/III</cite>, the <cite>IV</cite>
chord of the relative major key.) S&amp;A and D&amp;L have nearly identical
versions; Daily has the same chord changes, but many of the details of the
parts are different.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/190"><img alt="../../_images/ausmus62salvation.png" src="../../_images/ausmus62salvation.png" /></a>
<p>Some other highlights from D&amp;L and Daily that seem to have originated in S&amp;A include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An arrangement of SOCIAL BAND that leans heavily on the relative major (<a class="reference external" href="www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/29">S&amp;A 10</a>, D&amp;L 85, also in the Daily book as 262 AMBOY).</li>
<li>A reharmonization of the E Dorian tune LAND OF REST in which it is treated as if it were in D Major — requiring it to end in an unanswered cadence on the V chord to accomodate the final E (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/410">S&amp;A 150</a>, D&amp;L 135).</li>
<li>A startling Lydian-mode version of BRAY (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/120">S&amp;A 39</a>, D&amp;L 45), a tune which appeared in a plainer major arrangement in the Hesperian Harp (64).</li>
<li>An oddly Classical-sounding major-key version of STAR IN THE EAST (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/478">S&amp;A 185</a>, D&amp;L 24). <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f4" id="id3">[3]</a></li>
<li>KENTUCKY (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/52">S&amp;A 18</a>, D&amp;L 202), a pleasant but fairly tame reharmonization of Lucius Chapin&#8217;s PRIMROSE or NINETY-THIRD PSALM (SH 31).</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are some gems in S&amp;A that weren&#8217;t repeated in those later books,
including reharmonized versions of MINISTER&#8217;S FAREWELL (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/258">S&amp;A
86</a>) and RESTORATION (retitled I WILL
ARISE, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/32">S&amp;A 12</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-regional-trend">
<h2>A regional trend?<a class="headerlink" href="#a-regional-trend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many, though not all, of these highlights in S&amp;A are marked &#8220;Arranged by
T. B. A.&#8221; — almost certainly the initials of Thomas Box Ausmus, the book&#8217;s
second author. It is tempting to wonder if Ausmus might in fact have been the
source of all of these distinctive arrangements.</p>
<p>But that can&#8217;t be the whole story — for Daily and D&amp;L also have
reharmonizations in the same style that did not originate in S&amp;A.  This
suggests that the authors of the other books were not just copying from
Ausmus, but were participating in a larger stylistic trend along with him.</p>
<p>One especially dramatic example of the three books&#8217; independence from each
other is the tune IDUMEA. Each of the three books has its own version.  Sears
&amp; Ausmus (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/90">31</a>) leave the melody
unaltered, but reharmonize it entirely in the relative major up until the
final two bars.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/90"><img alt="../../_images/ausmus31idumea.png" src="../../_images/ausmus31idumea.png" /></a>
<p>Daily (125) leaves the tune in minor, though with more borrowings from the
relative major than were in the original, but he adds several chromatic
alterations to the melody. Durand &amp; Lester (177) take a similar approach
to Daily, but make different choices in reharmonizing the piece.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/HTBU1886/439)"><img alt="../../_images/lester177idumea.png" src="../../_images/lester177idumea.png" /></a>
<p>All three arrangements seem to me like &#8220;modernizations&#8221; of the tune in more or
less the same spirit.</p>
<p>So these arrangements weren&#8217;t just the work of a single eccentric arranger: the
authors of each book created some new arrangements of their own, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f5" id="id5">[4]</a>
followings similar stylistic trends.  In fact, I&#8217;m tempted to wonder whether
it may have been a regional or denominational trend. The three book&#8217;s authors
were members of the same faith, all worked within several decades of each
other, and all were connected in one way or another to a fairly small area
surrounding Saint Louis and Indianapolis. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f6" id="id6">[5]</a> This could be a coincidence.
(I have not looked at Primitive Baptist hymnals of that era from other
regions, or hymnals from other churches from that region.) But it could also
suggest that these authors were
participating in a local tradition. Perhaps Primitive Baptist congregations in
that place and time were beginning to sing in distinctive ways — preferring
major chords, using <cite>IV</cite> in major and <cite>IV/III</cite> in minor, becoming fond of
unanswered cadences — and these books&#8217; authors were echoing the new style in
their arrangements.</p>

The <cite>IV</cite> chord of the relative major (notated as <cite>IV/III</cite>) is based on the sixth scale degree; and so the dorian mode, which raises the sixth scale degree, makes that chord unavailable. One of the few exceptions is 271 ARKANSAS, a minor-key tune in the folk-hymn style which briefly features an open fifth &#8220;power chord&#8221; on <cite>IV/III</cite> (and is always sung in true minor rather than dorian), but it uses this chord very differently than Daily and company would have — it is part of a passage in which the bass follows the melody in parallel fifths. In the Daily book style, <cite>IV/III</cite> usually appears as part of traditional tonic-dominant-subdominant chord changes in the relative major, and parallel fifths of any sort are comparatively rare. The Makers of the Sacred Harp tells us the author of ARKANSAS was Shadrack Barnett of Carroll County, Georgia, who had no apparent connection to the arrangers discussed here.</td></tr>
